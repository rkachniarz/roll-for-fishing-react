# For the owner's review

Things Claude decided, guessed or wrote that the owner should look at when there's time. None of them block work.

**How to answer**, right here in the file:

- **Fine as it is:** delete the item. Deleted means settled.
- **Not looked at yet:** leave it untouched. It stays for another day.
- **A change or a question:** write under the item, indented as a quote. Claude answers the same way, and the thread
  carries on in place until it's settled:

  ```markdown
  - **The frog happens once per game** (`once: true`).
    > **Owner:** OK, but let it come back once a season.
    > **Claude:** Done: `once` can now be `season` too (D85).
  ```

When asked to go through the review, Claude takes every `**Owner:**` note in one pass:

- **A change:** Claude makes it, records a decision if it changes something, and deletes the item.
- **A question:** Claude answers it under the note.

Items with no note are left alone.

Newest first.

## Events (7.1–7.3)

- **The event format** (D84, `docs/events.md`): front matter, `## slide` headings, `- choice -> slide` bullets,
  indented `needs:` / `gain:` / `lose:` / `set:` / `clear:` lines. Worth reading the guide and trying a small event
  of your own before writing ten; the words are easy to change now and harder later.
- **The frog happens once per game** (`once: true`). Without it, +2 Luck could be farmed. It's at the Lake with weight
  1, the only event there.
- **A choice the player can't take is hidden**, as the prototype's comments said. WoW does the same with gossip
  options. The alternative is showing it greyed out with what it needs, which tells the player more.
- **The event meter** is the prototype's: a d20 per cast, +5 when the hook comes up empty, fires above 100, so about
  one event every 9–10 casts once there are events to fire. When it fires and nothing can happen, it empties anyway.
  It keeps filling while an event is open.
- **Luck and flags change silently;** items and XP get a log line: "You receive: [Iron key]", "You lose: [Bent
  fork]", "You gain 50 XP.". Starting an event writes nothing to the log.
- **The dialog** uses the same box as the full-bucket and title dialogs: title in gold, then the picture's frame (only
  when the event has `art`, 2:1), the text, and the choices as buttons with gold text. It can't be closed with Escape.
  A click in its first 0.4 s is ignored, so a Space press or tap that ended the cast can't pick a choice by accident.
- **Events are checked after time has moved on,** so `needs: time dawn` means the cast ended at dawn.
- **`trigger: needs` events are checked anywhere,** not per location: the angry deity finds you wherever you are.
